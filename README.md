# Financial Transaction Analysis and Visualisation

This project analyzes financial transaction data to identify spending trends, anomalies, and potential fraud. The workflow covers data acquisition, cleaning, merging, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization with Python libraries, and interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, plotly)
- AWS S3
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebooks
- VS Code

## Project Steps

1. Data acquisition and storage (using AWS S3 for large files)
2. Data cleaning and merging with pandas
3. Exploratory data analysis and visualization (seaborn, plotly)
4. Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

## Notes

- Large datasets are stored on AWS S3 due to size constraints.
- See code and notebooks for step-by-step analysis.
